The MUST Busters project is a Python-based utility designed to scan and analyze network-based multi-user shared folders. It gives insights into data storage patterns across NCHHSTP shares. Helping the center understand **where** data resides, **how much** is stored (in **terabytes**), and **how old** it is. This tool was develop to support IT, Informatics and data governance teams in managing and planning network storage usage more effectively.

## üßê What is a Multi-User Share?

A **multi-user share** is a network folder accessible by a designated group of users. These are typically accessed via mapped drives or the **My Network Places** feature in Windows. This tool identifies and reports on these shares to assist with centralized storage management.
**MUST** (Multi-User Share Tool) is  multi-user share is a network-based file folder that can only be accessed by a designated group of users. Generally, these are accessed on your computer through the My Network Places icon. This tool is used to request new multi-user shares and to manage access to established multi-user shares.

## üß≠ Shared Drive Scanner Overview

- Performs recursive scans of one or more shared root directories
  - Collects and stores detailed metadata for:
  - Total storage used, measured in terabytes (TB)
  - File counts by directory and file type
  - File age statistics, including:
    - Oldest and newest file timestamps
    -Average last modified time
  - Storage usage breakdown by subdirectory, depth, and hierarchy
- All results are persisted in a normalized SQL database schema
  - Enables efficient querying, reporting, and integration with dashboards  
  - Supersedes prior CSV or JSON output formats, which are no longer practical at scale
  - Includes a logging system for traceability, diagnostics, and error auditing
